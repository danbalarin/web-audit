= Existing Solutions

The existing solutions for website auditing are diverse, employing various methodologies to evaluate and enhance these factors. 
This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the current tools and approaches used in website quality assurance, with a particular focus on black-box auditing techniques that operate without access to a website's source code or internal systems.
In following chapters, we delve into specific aspects of website quality, such as web accessibility, which ensures that websites are usable by people with disabilities; performance optimisation strategies that improve loading times and responsiveness; and security measures that protect against vulnerabilities and cyber threats. 
Further sections examine the importance of #abbr.l("SEO") in increasing a website's visibility, as well as the roles of usability and user experience in retaining user engagement and satisfaction. 

The chapter concludes with an exploration of the limitations and challenges inherent in existing solutions, identifying gaps where current tools may fall short. 
This gap analysis is instrumental in setting the stage for developing a more integrated auditing approach that combines automated and manual techniques.
