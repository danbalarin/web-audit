== International Organisation for Standardisation

The #abbr.l("ISO") is an independent, non-governmental international organisation that develops and publishes a wide range of proprietary, industrial, and commercial standards.
Founded in 1947 and headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, ISO operates in 167 countries through its national standards bodies. 
By bringing together experts from around the world, ISO aims to facilitate global trade, ensure quality, safety, and efficiency, and foster innovation across various industries and technologies.

ISO's mission is to promote the development of standardisation and related activities globally to facilitate the international exchange of goods and services.
It seeks to develop cooperation in intellectual, scientific, technological, and economic activities. 
The organisation strives to create consensus-based, market-relevant standards that support innovation, provide solutions to global challenges, and contribute to the United Nations #abbr.pla("SDG"). 
By removing barriers to international trade through harmonising standards across different countries, ISO enables products and services to be accepted worldwide.

Ensuring quality and safety is a core objective, as ISO promotes standards that help ensure products and services are safe, reliable, and of good quality. 
This commitment protects consumers and businesses alike. 
In supporting innovation, ISO encourages the adoption of new technologies and best practices by providing frameworks that support research and development.
Operating through technical committees composed of experts from relevant industries, consumer associations, academia, #abbr.pls("NGO"), and government bodies, ISO's collaborative approach ensures that its standards reflect a balance of international knowledge and experience.

=== Key Standards and Specifications

ISO has published over 23,000 international standards covering almost every industry, from technology to food safety, agriculture to healthcare. 
In the context of web development and information technology, several key standards are particularly relevant.

The #abbr.s("ISO")/#abbr.s("IEC") 27000 Series is a family of standards dealing with information security management systems (ISMS), providing best practices for managing information security. 
Among these, ISO/IEC 27001 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an ISMS, aiming to help organisations keep information assets secure. 
ISO/IEC 27002 offers guidelines for organisational information security standards and information security management practices, including the selection, implementation, and management of controls.

Another important standard is ISO/IEC 12207, which provides a common framework for software life cycle processes. 
It covers the planning, development, operation, maintenance, and disposal of software products and services, ensuring consistency and quality throughout the software's life. 
ISO 9241 is a multi-part standard covering the ergonomics of human-computer interaction, including usability requirements for the design and evaluation of software and hardware interfaces, promoting user-friendly and accessible technology.

Furthermore, ISO 40500 recognises the #link(<WAI>, "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)") 2.0 as an ISO standard, promoting accessibility for people with disabilities. 
By adopting these guidelines, developers can create web content that is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust, ensuring inclusivity and compliance with legal requirements.

Although some ISO standards, such as ISO 8601, are not exclusively designed for web applications, they are nevertheless widely adopted in this context due to their utility in standardising data representation. 
ISO 8601 specifies an international standard for the representation and exchange of date and time values, aiming to eliminate inconsistencies and ambiguities arising from different time zones and formatting conventions. 
In computing, particularly within web applications, it is common practice to represent date and time information using either the ISO 8601 string format or the epoch time format. 
The ISO string format provides a human-readable yet standardised representation, while epoch time represents the number of milliseconds elapsed since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). 
Both formats are integral to consistently handling, storing, and exchanging temporal data across different systems and platforms. 
Therefore, adherence to standards like ISO 8601 is a critical component of web application quality assurance, as it ensures interoperability and reduces potential errors related to date and time processing.

These standards contribute significantly to the development of reliable, secure, and user-friendly web applications and services.

=== Emerging Trends and Future Directions

ISO continues to evolve its standards to address emerging technologies and challenges in the digital world. 
In the field of cybersecurity, ISO is developing new standards and updating existing ones to tackle the increasing complexity of cyber threats and the need for robust security measures. 
Regarding cloud computing, ISO is establishing standards for cloud services to ensure security, privacy, and interoperability across different platforms and providers.

In artificial intelligence (AI), ISO is creating frameworks and guidelines for the ethical and responsible development and use of AI technologies, addressing concerns around bias, transparency, and accountability. 

By staying at the forefront of technological advancements, ISO ensures that its standards remain relevant and effective in guiding organisations through new challenges. 
This proactive approach helps organisations adapt to change, embrace innovation, and maintain compliance with best practices.
