== Mozilla

Mozilla is a globally recognised, non-profit organisation dedicated to ensuring that the Internet remains an open and accessible resource for all. 
Mozilla's mission is to promote openness, innovation, and opportunity on the Internet. 
Guided by the principles outlined in the Mozilla Manifesto, the organisation believes that the Internet should be a global public resource that is open and accessible to everyone. 
Mozilla advocates for an Internet that enriches the lives of individual users, where security and privacy are fundamental, and individuals have the power to shape their own online experiences.

One of Mozilla's most significant contributions to the Internet is the development of the Firefox web browser. 
Launched in 2004, Firefox quickly gained popularity as a fast, secure, and user-friendly alternative to dominant browsers of the time. 
Firefox championed features like tabbed browsing, integrated search, and pop-up blocking, setting new browser functionality and user experience standards.

Firefox is built on the Gecko layout engine, an open-source rendering engine developed by Mozilla. 
Gecko is responsible for interpreting web content, including #abbr.s("HTML"), #abbr.s("CSS"), and JavaScript, and rendering it on the user's screen. 
By developing and maintaining Gecko, Mozilla has played a crucial role in promoting web standards and ensuring consistent rendering of web pages across different platforms and devices.

In response to the increasing complexity of web applications and the need for better performance, Mozilla initiated the development of the Quantum project. 
Released in 2017, Firefox Quantum represented a significant overhaul of the browser's architecture, focusing on speed, efficiency, and responsiveness. 
By leveraging technologies like the Servo parallel browser engine and the Rust programming language, Quantum improved resource utilisation and load times, enhancing the overall user experience.

Mozilla is also the creator and maintainer of HTTP Observatory, a free, open-source service and library that tests websites for security headers.
This service can easily pinpoint the most basic security problems, like vulnerability to #abbr.a("CSRF") or #abbr.s("HTTPS") downgrade attack.

#abbr.s("MDN") Web Docs, one of the most comprehensive and authoritative resources for web development documentation, is also maintained by Mozilla. 
MDN Web Docs offers detailed guides, references, and tutorials on web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web #abbr.pls("API"). 
By providing high-quality, up-to-date documentation, Mozilla supports developers worldwide in building standards-compliant and innovative web applications.

Another notable project is #abbr.a("Wasm"), a low-level bytecode that allows developers to run high-performance applications in web browsers.
Mozilla has been a key player in the development of WebAssembly, enabling languages like C, C++, and Rust to be compiled to the web platform.
This technology expands the capabilities of web applications, allowing for more complex and compute-intensive tasks to be performed efficiently within the browser.
