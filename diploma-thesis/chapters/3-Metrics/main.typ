= Metrics

As we have already outlined in previous chapters, ensuring the quality of a website is a multifaceted endeavour that spans numerous areas, each with its own set of metrics to consider. 
These areas include performance optimisation, accessibility compliance, user experience design, security measures, and adherence to web standards, among others. 
Each domain contributes uniquely to the overall functionality and success of a website, and within each, certain metrics emerge as more critical than others.

To achieve the most comprehensive and effective audit possible, we need to identify and understand the majority of these metrics, assessing not only their individual significance but also how they interact and impact the website holistically. 
This involves a careful analysis of each metric's influence on factors such as user satisfaction, engagement, and conversion rates. 
By stating how impactful they are, we can prioritise our focus on the metrics that will drive the most meaningful improvements. 
This approach ensures that our auditing process is both thorough and strategically targeted, ultimately enhancing the quality and performance of the websites we evaluate.
