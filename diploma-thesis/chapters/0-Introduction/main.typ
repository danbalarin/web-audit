In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, websites have become indispensable tools for businesses, organisations, and individuals alike.
They are the primary interface for communication, commerce, and information dissemination.
However, the effectiveness and reliability of a website are contingent upon adherence to established standards and best practices.
Therefore, website auditing plays a crucial role in ensuring that websites meet these standards, enhancing user experience, accessibility, and overall performance.

Website auditing encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of various aspects of a website, including its design, functionality, performance, security, and compliance with industry standards.
This process is essential for identifying areas of improvement and ensuring that the website aligns with the goals and objectives of the organisation.
The standards and guidelines for website development are established by several authoritative bodies, each contributing to different facets of web development.

This thesis addresses the need for an effective solution to audit websites comprehensively without the access to their source code or internal systems.
By developing a web application that combines automated and manual auditing techniques, this work aims to bridge the gap in current website auditing practices and offer a simplified approach to quality assurance.
