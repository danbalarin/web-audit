#heading(numbering: none)[Introduction]

In today's digital landscape, websites serve as critical touchpoints for businesses, organisations, and individuals, functioning as primary interfaces for communication, commerce, and information dissemination. The effectiveness of these digital platforms depends heavily on their adherence to established standards across multiple dimensions including accessibility, performance, security, and user experience. As websites grow increasingly complex and user expectations continue to rise, comprehensive quality assurance has become not just beneficial but essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring regulatory compliance.

This thesis addresses a significant gap in the current website auditing ecosystem: the need for an integrated solution that can comprehensively evaluate website quality without requiring access to source code or internal systems. While numerous specialised tools exist for assessing individual aspects of website quality, they often operate in isolation, creating fragmentation in the auditing process and potentially overlooking critical interdependencies between different quality dimensions.

The primary goal of this research is to develop and implement a novel approach to website quality assurance that combines automated testing with guided manual evaluation. This approach aims to provide a more holistic assessment than currently available solutions by:

#v(1em)
1. Identifying and measuring critical metrics across multiple quality dimensions including accessibility, performance, security, search engine optimisation, and user experience
2. Automating the evaluation of technically measurable aspects while providing structured frameworks for aspects requiring human judgment
3. Creating a unified platform that consolidates findings across all dimensions, enabling comprehensive analysis and prioritisation of improvements
4. Supporting comparative analysis across multiple audit iterations to track improvements over time

The research methodology encompasses a thorough analysis of existing standards, tools, and best practices established by authoritative bodies such as the #abbr.a("W3C"), #abbr.a("IETF"), and industry leaders like Google and Mozilla. This foundation informs the development of a practical application that implements the combined auditing approach, which is then evaluated through case studies to demonstrate its effectiveness.

The expected contributions of this work include not only the practical application itself but also a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between different aspects of website quality and how they collectively impact user experience and business outcomes. By bridging the gap between automated and manual evaluation techniques, this research aims to advance the field of website quality assurance and provide practitioners with more effective tools for creating and maintaining high-quality web experiences.
