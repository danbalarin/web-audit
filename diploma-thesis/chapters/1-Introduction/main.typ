= Introduction

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, websites have become indispensable tools for businesses, organisations, and individuals alike.
They are the primary interface for communication, commerce, and information dissemination.
However, the effectiveness and reliability of a website are contingent upon adherence to established standards and best practices.
Therefore, website auditing plays a crucial role in ensuring that websites meet these standards, enhancing user experience, accessibility, and overall performance.

Website auditing encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of various aspects of a website, including its design, functionality, performance, security, and compliance with industry standards.
This process is essential for identifying areas of improvement and ensuring that the website aligns with the goals and objectives of the organisation.
The standards and guidelines for website development are established by several authoritative bodies, each contributing to different facets of web development.

This thesis addresses the need for an effective solution to audit websites comprehensively without the access to their source code or internal systems.
By developing a web application that combines automated and manual auditing techniques, this work aims to bridge the gap in current website auditing practices and offer a simplified approach to quality assurance.

== Main Bodies in Website Standardisation

In the dynamic and ever-evolving field of web development, standardisation plays a crucial role in ensuring that websites are accessible, secure, and interoperable across different platforms and devices.
Standardisation bodies establish guidelines and protocols that developers and organisations can follow to create a cohesive and user-friendly web experience.
This is particularly important in the context of website auditing, where compliance with these standards is essential for evaluating the quality and performance of web applications.

Several key organisations lead the efforts in defining and promoting web standards.

The #abbr.a("W3C"), founded by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is at the forefront of developing open standards that ensure the long-term growth and accessibility of the web.
#abbr.a("IETF") focuses on the technical aspects of internet architecture, promoting standards that facilitate smooth and reliable network operations and #abbr.a("ISO") provides comprehensive frameworks across various industries, including crucial standards for information security in web applications.

In addition to these traditional standardisation bodies, influential technology companies like Google and Mozilla contribute significantly to web standards.
Google's initiatives, such as Web Vitals, emphasise performance metrics that enhance user experience, while Mozilla advocates for an open and accessible internet through resources like the #abbr.s("MDN") Web Docs.
Their contributions help shape modern web practices and influence how websites are developed and audited.

Understanding the roles and guidelines of these main bodies is essential for conducting effective website audits. By adhering to the standards they set forth, developers can ensure that their websites not only meet quality and performance benchmarks but also provide a secure and inclusive experience for all users.
The following sections delve deeper into each of these organisations, exploring their specific contributions to web standardisation and how they impact website quality assurance.
