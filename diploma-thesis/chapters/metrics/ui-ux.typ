== UI/UX

#revisit[
  This chapter describes how to methodically audit websites from UI and UX perspective.
  UI and UX is by definition highly subjective and tight to the preferences of the company/brand, but there are still some areas that can be objectively evaluated.

  The main area of this section that can be evaluated is the user perception.
  For example, how would Facebook feel if they'd replace their primary blue color with red or neon orange?
  This goes into the field of semiotics, the meaning of signs and symbols.

=== Motivation

#revisit[
  The perception of website, feeling it gives to the customer, flashes of text and shifts in page is subconsciously interpreted as seriousness of the company which affects the company's outlook.
  Also in the times of scams waiting behind every corner the thing we want last is to look like one.
  The devil's in the details.
