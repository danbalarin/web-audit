The goal of this thesis was to identify key metrics abroad that can describe website quality, find out which of them can be automated and lastly create an application that can conduct automated checks and support user in assessing the manual ones.
This simplifies evaluation of website quality, as there are no other tools that would do comprehensive audit in this scope.

We began by identifying the key bodies and metrics involved in website quality assurance, focusing on aspects such as usability, accessibility standards, performance, and security protocols. 
These insights helped shape the requirements for a robust website auditing application that operates without needing access to the website's internal code or systems.

The development and implementation phase of the thesis culminated in an application capable of delivering comprehensive audits. 
This tool, distinguished by its ability to automate many audit aspects while also supporting manual evaluations where necessary, effectively bridges the gap left by existing solutions. 
Key features include the ability to conduct audits, compare findings, and assist users in interpreting the results through a user-friendly interface.

Our evaluation of the application highlighted its strengths and the successful fulfilment of primary and secondary functional requirements. 
However, it also revealed areas for future enhancement. 
These enhancements could include improved ease of setup, speed of the automated part, and the usage of advancing technologies, such as large language models, to further refine auditing processes.

Overall, this thesis successfully identified key metrics, architected extendable system and implemented the application. 
The functional and non-functional requirements of the application were met as was concluded in @evaluation.

Even with some limitations of the application mentioned in @limitations, the application still simplifies conduction of audit and helps user understand the metrics by including knowledge base.
