On the one hand, current practice is to resort to metrics, such as the document completion time ({onLoad}), that are simple to measure though knowingly inaccurate. On the other hand, there are metrics, like Google’s {SpeedIndex}, that are better correlated with the actual user experience, but are quite complex to evaluate and, as such, relegated to lab experiments. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive state of the art on the metrics and tools available for {WebQoE} assessment. We then apply these metrics to a representative dataset (the Alexa top-100 webpages) to better illustrate their similarities, differences, advantages, and limitations. We next introduce novel metrics, inspired by Google’s {SpeedIndex}, that offer significant advantage in terms of computational complexity, while maintaining a high correlation with the {SpeedIndex}. These properties make our proposed metrics highly relevant and of practical use.},

The main goal was to improve the quality and productivity of the additive. The study finally analyzed important metrics such as number of {HTTP} requests, duration of {HTTP} requests, {HTTP} request waits, {HTTP} requests per second, as well as key indicators such as First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, Total Blocking Time, cumulative layout shift and speed index. The results of this analysis show significant improvements in all the specified metrics, which undoubtedly emphasizes the effectiveness of the optimization methods and tools used. The number of {HTTP} requests has increased and their duration has decreased, which degrades the overall speed of processing requests. It is important to note that the page load time has become significantly faster, with a significant reduction in First Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint. These improvements not only enhanced the user experience, but also positioned the app as more competitive in the market.},

Every piece of the web application stack, from {HTTP} requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape.In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world's top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why they're fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. You'll learn how to: Perform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as {URL} parsing and {HTML} {sanitizationUse} modern security features like Strict Transport Security, Content Security Policy, and Cross-Origin Resource {SharingLeverage} many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of {XSS} {bugsBuild} mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation {policyEmbed} or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content {sniffingFor} quick reference, "Security Engineering Cheat Sheets" at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems you're most likely to encounter.

This allows software developers to understand areas of improvement within a website. However, accessibility becomes an issue when it comes to rapidly handling multiple input for generating performance report consisting different formats with better accuracy. In this work, a test on set of improvements to enhance the reference Google Lighthouse architecture was conducted to enable it to process multiple file input types with the focus of producing different output format including better accuracy. Multiple experimental runs involving different size of file input were conducted by comparing the results from using the modified Lighthouse with the original Lighthouse. The results proves the feasibility of the enhancement and can further improve the accuracy of performance audit report with known Lighthouse performance metrics.},

	abstract = {Developers deploying web applications in the cloud often need to determine how changes such as service tiers or runtime loads may affect user-perceived page load time. We devise and evaluate a systematic methodology for exploring such "what-if" questions at the time a web application is deployed. Given a website, a web request, and “whatif” scenario, with a hypothetical configuration and runtime condition, our methodology, embedded in a system called {WebPerf}, can estimate a distribution of end-to-end response times for the request under the “what-if” scenario. {WebPerf} makes three contributions: (1) automated instrumentation of web sites written with increasingly popular task parallel libraries, to capture causal call dependencies of various computation and asynchronous I/O calls; (2) an algorithm to use the call dependencies, together with online- and offlineprofiled models of various I/O calls to estimate a distribution of end-to-end latency of the request; and (3) an algorithm to optimize modeling errors by deciding how many measurements to take within a limited time. We have implemented {WebPerf} for Microsoft Azure. Our experiments with five real websites and seven scenarios show that the median error of {WebPerf}’s estimation is within 7\% for all applications and scenarios.},
