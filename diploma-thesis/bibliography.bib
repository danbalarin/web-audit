	shorttitle = {{HTTP}},
	abstract = {Behind every web transaction lies the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ({HTTP}) --- the language of web browsers and servers, of portals and search engines, of e-commerce and web services. Understanding {HTTP} is essential for practically all web-based programming, design, analysis, and administration.While the basics of {HTTP} are elegantly simple, the protocol's advanced features are notoriously confusing, because they knit together complex technologies and terminology from many disciplines. This book clearly explains {HTTP} and these interrelated core technologies, in twenty-one logically organized chapters, backed up by hundreds of detailed illustrations and examples, and convenient reference appendices. {HTTP}: The Definitive Guide explains everything people need to use {HTTP} efficiently -- including the "black arts" and "tricks of the trade" -- in a concise and readable manner.In addition to explaining the basic {HTTP} features, syntax and guidelines, this book clarifies related, but often misunderstood topics, such as: {TCP} connection management, web proxy and cache architectures, web robots and robots.txt files, Basic and Digest authentication, secure {HTTP} transactions, entity body processing, internationalized content, and traffic redirection.Many technical professionals will benefit from this book. Internet architects and developers who need to design and develop software, {IT} professionals who need to understand Internet architectural components and interactions, multimedia designers who need to publish and host multimedia, performance engineers who need to optimize web performance, technical marketing professionals who need a clear picture of core web architectures and protocols, as well as untold numbers of students and hobbyists will all benefit from the knowledge packed in this volume.There are many books that explain how to use the Web, but this is the one that explains how the Web works. Written by experts with years of design and implementation experience, this book is the definitive technical bible that describes the "why" and the "how" of {HTTP} and web core technologies. {HTTP}: The Definitive Guide is an essential reference that no technically-inclined member of the Internet community should be without.},

It does an excellent job describing how test automation differs from other test activities, and clearly lays out what kind of skills and knowledge are needed to automate tests. The book is essential reading for students of testing and a bible for practitioners.”–Jeff Offutt, Professor of Software Engineering, George Mason University   “This new book naturally expands upon its predecessor, Automated Software Testing, and is the perfect reference for software practitioners applying automated software testing to their development efforts. Mandatory reading for software testing professionals!” –Jeff Rashka, {PMP}, Coauthor of Automated Software Testing and Quality Web Systems  Testing accounts for an increasingly large percentage of the time and cost of new software development. Using automated software testing ({AST}), developers and software testers can optimize the software testing lifecycle and thus reduce cost. As technologies and development grow increasingly complex, {AST} becomes even more indispensable. This book builds on some of the proven practices and the automated testing lifecycle methodology ({ATLM}) described in Automated Software Testing and provides a renewed practical, start-to-finish guide to implementing {AST} successfully.  In  Implementing Automated Software Testing, three leading experts explain {AST} in detail, systematically reviewing its components, capabilities, and limitations. Drawing on their experience deploying {AST} in both defense and commercial industry, they walk you through the entire implementation process–identifying best practices, crucial success factors, and key pitfalls along with solutions for avoiding them. You will learn how to:    Make a realistic business case for {AST}, and use it to drive your initiative   Clarify your testing requirements and develop an automation strategy that reflects them   Build efficient test environments and choose the right automation tools and techniques for your environment   Use proven metrics to continuously track your progress and adjust accordingly Whether you’re a test professional, {QA} specialist, project manager, or developer, this book can help you bring unprecedented efficiency to testing–and then use {AST} to improve your entire development lifecycle.},

On the other hand, there are metrics, like Google’s {SpeedIndex}, that are better correlated with the actual user experience, but are quite complex to evaluate and, as such, relegated to lab experiments. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive state of the art on the metrics and tools available for {WebQoE} assessment. We then apply these metrics to a representative dataset (the Alexa top-100 webpages) to better illustrate their similarities, differences, advantages, and limitations. We next introduce novel metrics, inspired by Google’s {SpeedIndex}, that offer significant advantage in terms of computational complexity, while maintaining a high correlation with the {SpeedIndex}. These properties make our proposed metrics highly relevant and of practical use.},

The study finally analyzed important metrics such as number of {HTTP} requests, duration of {HTTP} requests, {HTTP} request waits, {HTTP} requests per second, as well as key indicators such as First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, Total Blocking Time, cumulative layout shift and speed index. The results of this analysis show significant improvements in all the specified metrics, which undoubtedly emphasizes the effectiveness of the optimization methods and tools used. The number of {HTTP} requests has increased and their duration has decreased, which degrades the overall speed of processing requests. It is important to note that the page load time has become significantly faster, with a significant reduction in First Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint. These improvements not only enhanced the user experience, but also positioned the app as more competitive in the market.},

	shorttitle = {Practical Web Accessibility},
	abstract = {Everyone deserves to use the Internet. An estimated 1.3 billion people experience significant disability. That’s 16percent of the world’s population, or one in six of us. At the same time, over 96 percent of the one million most popular websites have an accessibility issue. Add to this the massive rise in legal cases around sites not being accessible, including Beyoncé, Disney, and Netflix, and you have an important topic that more and more people are starting to engage with.In this updated and revamped second edition of the Amazon technology chart-topping Practical Web Accessibility, you’ll be guided through a broad range of disabilities and access needs. You’ll understand the ways these users typically engage with the web, the barriers they often face, and practical advice on how your websites and content can be compliant, but more than that, inclusive and enjoyable to use. There’s also a new chapter on “Outsourcing Accessibility,” exploring third party “bolt-on” tools, “build your own website” platforms like Wix, and popular design systems. You‘ll explore whether they’re helpful or detrimental in the fight to make the web more accessible.Throughout this book you’ll learn to test for, spot, and fix web accessibility issues for a wide range of physical and mental impairments. Featuring content from the latest compliance frameworks, including the newly released {WCAG} 2.2 and exploratory concepts in {WCAG} 3, you’ll see how to go beyond the basic requirements in order to help your users. You’ll also learn that an accessible approach won’t just help people with disabilities, it will improve your website for everyone.This book comes complete with practical examples you can use in your own sites, along with a brand-new approach to auditing and improving a website’s accessibility, and a team’s approach to it, based on tools created by the author and refined over years as a consultant — The {FAIR} framework and {ACCESS} checklist. With these tools, you can set up processes for yourself and your team that will drastically improve the accessibility of your sites and, importantly, keep them that way in the future. Suitable for those of any profession or experience level, Practical Web Accessibility gives you all the information you need to ensure that your sites are truly accessible for the modern, inclusive web. If you would like to learn about web accessibility in a clear and actionable way, this book is for you.What You Will {LearnA} greater understanding of a vast range of disabilities that have online access needs, and the issues they typically face accessing content online.Ways to apply the practical steps required to cater for those needs.How to take your sites, and colleagues, on a journey from being inaccessible to accessible.The importance of accessibility in your designs, code, content, and more.The best ways to test andimprove your sites, so you can be compliant, and truly accessible.

	shorttitle = {Pro Single Page Application Development},
	abstract = {One of the most important and exciting trends in web development in recent years is the move towards single page applications, or {SPAs}. Instead of clicking through hyperlinks and waiting for each page to load, the user loads a site once and all the interactivity is handled fluidly by a rich {JavaScript} front end. If you come from a background in {ASP}.{NET} development, you’ll be used to handling most interactions on the server side. Pro Single Page Application Development will guide you through your transition to this powerful new application type.The book starts in Part I by laying the groundwork for {SPA} development. You’ll master some {JavaScript} techniques that will come in useful later on, and get to know the building blocks of a single page application, including modules, routing and {MV}* frameworks.In Part {II}, you’ll build the client for your application. This is where the magic happens, as the authors take you through the process step by step. Backbone.js is the ideal library for demonstrating {SPA} development in practice, but you can apply the same principles with other frameworks in your future applications. Part {III} takes you through the process of building the server side of your application using {ASP}.{NET} Web {API}, and hooking up the two parts of your application to create a working whole. {SPA} development also comes with its own particular challenges, including tracking history, user interface performance, and how to handle search engine optimization. In the final chapters, the authors guide you through some of these issues and advanced techniques and finish by showing you how to deploy your application. As {SPAs} become the de facto standard of web application development, the in-depth Pro Single Page Application Development will be your one-stop shop for creating fluid, modern applications on the web.},

Every piece of the web application stack, from {HTTP} requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape.In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world's top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why they're fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. You'll learn how to: Perform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as {URL} parsing and {HTML} {sanitizationUse} modern security features like Strict Transport Security, Content Security Policy, and Cross-Origin Resource {SharingLeverage} many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of {XSS} {bugsBuild} mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation {policyEmbed} or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content {sniffingFor} quick reference, "Security Engineering Cheat Sheets" at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems you're most likely to encounter.

This allows software developers to understand areas of improvement within a website. However, accessibility becomes an issue when it comes to rapidly handling multiple input for generating performance report consisting different formats with better accuracy. In this work, a test on set of improvements to enhance the reference Google Lighthouse architecture was conducted to enable it to process multiple file input types with the focus of producing different output format including better accuracy. Multiple experimental runs involving different size of file input were conducted by comparing the results from using the modified Lighthouse with the original Lighthouse. The results proves the feasibility of the enhancement and can further improve the accuracy of performance audit report with known Lighthouse performance metrics.},

	abstract = {Developers deploying web applications in the cloud often need to determine how changes such as service tiers or runtime loads may affect user-perceived page load time. We devise and evaluate a systematic methodology for exploring such "what-if" questions at the time a web application is deployed. Given a website, a web request, and “whatif” scenario, with a hypothetical configuration and runtime condition, our methodology, embedded in a system called {WebPerf}, can estimate a distribution of end-to-end response times for the request under the “what-if” scenario. {WebPerf} makes three contributions: (1) automated instrumentation of web sites written with increasingly popular task parallel libraries, to capture causal call dependencies of various computation and asynchronous I/O calls; (2) an algorithm to use the call dependencies, together with online- and offlineprofiled models of various I/O calls to estimate a distribution of end-to-end latency of the request; and (3) an algorithm to optimize modeling errors by deciding how many measurements to take within a limited time. We have implemented {WebPerf} for Microsoft Azure. Our experiments with five real websites and seven scenarios show that the median error of {WebPerf}’s estimation is within 7\% for all applications and scenarios.},
