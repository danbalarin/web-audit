## WCAG 2.2 Level AA

WCAG 2.2 Level AA represents the most current intermediate level of accessibility conformance. This metric evaluates a website's compliance with the latest published guidelines, incorporating all requirements from WCAG 2.1 Level AA plus new criteria focused on cognitive accessibility, mobile devices, and users with low vision.

WCAG 2.2 builds upon previous versions by adding new success criteria and refining existing ones. These additions address emerging accessibility challenges and incorporate insights from ongoing accessibility research and user feedback.

Key additions in WCAG 2.2 Level AA include:

- Focus Appearance: Improving visibility of keyboard focus indicators
- Dragging Movements: Providing alternatives to dragging interactions
- Target Size: Ensuring interactive elements are large enough to activate easily
- Consistent Help: Making help mechanisms available consistently
- Accessible Authentication: Providing alternatives to cognitive function tests
- Redundant Entry: Avoiding requiring users to re-enter information
- Findable Help: Making help features easy to locate

These new criteria particularly benefit users with cognitive disabilities, motor impairments, and those using mobile or touchscreen devices. They address practical challenges encountered in everyday web usage that weren't fully addressed in earlier versions.

As the most recent standard, WCAG 2.2 Level AA reflects the current best practices for accessibility. Organizations seeking to maintain the most up-to-date accessibility standards should work toward compliance with WCAG 2.2 Level AA criteria.

A high score in this metric indicates that a website implements contemporary accessibility features and addresses barriers across a comprehensive range of disabilities and scenarios. It demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to accessibility that anticipates user needs.

By meeting WCAG 2.2 Level AA criteria, websites provide enhanced accessibility for all users, particularly those with cognitive disabilities or using mobile devices, helping to ensure digital content is available to the widest possible audience.
