## W3C approved Accessibility Conformance Testing rules

The W3C Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules are a standardized set of tests designed to evaluate web content against specific accessibility criteria. This metric specifically focuses on evaluating compliance with the ACT Rules framework, which is a subset of all accessibility requirements.

ACT Rules provide clear, consistent testing procedures for certain accessibility criteria with explicit pass/fail conditions. Unlike broader accessibility guidelines, ACT Rules are formally approved by the W3C, ensuring they accurately represent the intended requirements and can be consistently implemented across evaluation tools.

Each ACT Rule addresses a specific testable aspect of web accessibility, such as proper implementation of ARIA landmarks, keyboard functionality for interactive elements, or text alternatives for non-text content. The rules are designed to be atomic, meaning each rule tests one specific aspect of accessibility.

The benefit of ACT Rules is their precision. They remove ambiguity from accessibility testing by providing detailed testing procedures and examples of both passing and failing cases. This helps developers understand exactly what is required to meet specific accessibility criteria.

A high score in this metric indicates that a website passes the specific ACT Rules that were tested. However, it's important to note that ACT Rules do not cover all WCAG requirements, as the W3C continues to develop and approve new rules over time. Therefore, this metric should be considered alongside other accessibility metrics for a comprehensive assessment.

By focusing on ACT Rules compliance, developers can address specific, well-defined accessibility issues with confidence in the testing methodology. This metric serves as an indicator of alignment with officially approved accessibility testing procedures rather than comprehensive accessibility compliance.
