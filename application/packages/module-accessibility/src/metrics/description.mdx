# Accessibility

Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of ensuring websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them effectively. This category evaluates a website's adherence to various accessibility standards and best practices that make digital content perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users.

The accessibility metrics in this module are based on automated tests using the Axe accessibility testing engine, which evaluates web content against established guidelines including different versions and conformance levels of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) as well as other accessibility best practices.

These metrics provide insights into how well a website accommodates users with diverse abilities, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. By addressing accessibility barriers, websites not only comply with legal requirements in many jurisdictions but also expand their potential audience and demonstrate a commitment to digital inclusion.

It's important to note that while these automated tests can identify many accessibility issues, they cannot detect all potential barriers. Some aspects of accessibility require human judgment and testing with actual assistive technologies. Therefore, these metrics should be considered as indicators of potential accessibility issues rather than a comprehensive assessment of accessibility compliance.

By monitoring and improving these accessibility metrics, website owners can work toward creating a more inclusive digital environment that serves the needs of all users, regardless of their abilities or the technologies they use to access the web.
