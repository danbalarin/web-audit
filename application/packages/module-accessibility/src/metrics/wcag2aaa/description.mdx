## WCAG 2.0 Level AAA

WCAG 2.0 Level AAA represents the highest level of accessibility conformance in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. This metric evaluates a website's compliance with all Level A, Level AA, and the additional Level AAA criteria, providing the most comprehensive assessment of accessibility.

Level AAA criteria address subtle and specific barriers that might affect certain groups of users with disabilities. These requirements go beyond the standard expectations to provide enhanced accessibility features that make content more accessible across an even wider range of situations and disabilities.

Key WCAG 2.0 Level AAA requirements include:

- Providing sign language interpretation for prerecorded audio content
- Offering extended audio description for video content
- Using simpler language (lower secondary education level)
- Providing pronunciation guidance for unusual words
- Achieving higher contrast ratios between text and background
- Avoiding any content that flashes (not just at certain rates)
- Allowing users to skip or control any auto-updating content
- Making all functionality available via keyboard without exceptions
- Providing context-sensitive help for complex functionality
- Offering comprehensive error prevention mechanisms

Level AAA conformance is rarely required as a whole in accessibility policies or legislation, as it sets an extremely high bar that may not be achievable or appropriate for all types of content. Instead, organizations often implement specific Level AAA requirements that are relevant to their particular context or audience.

A high score in this metric indicates exceptional attention to accessibility concerns and represents best-in-class practices. Websites achieving substantial conformance with Level AAA criteria demonstrate the highest commitment to digital inclusion.

By implementing WCAG 2.0 Level AAA requirements where feasible, websites can provide the most accessible experience possible for users with disabilities, potentially reaching audiences that might otherwise be unable to use digital content effectively.
