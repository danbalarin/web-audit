## Common accessibility best practices

Accessibility best practices encompass a range of recommendations and techniques that go beyond formal guidelines to enhance the usability of websites for people with disabilities. This metric evaluates adherence to generally accepted accessibility principles that may not be explicitly covered in formal standards like WCAG but are nonetheless important for creating inclusive digital experiences.

These best practices have emerged from real-world experience, user research, and industry consensus. They address common barriers that people with disabilities encounter when navigating the web and provide practical solutions to these challenges. While they may not be legally mandated in the same way as formal guidelines, they represent the collective wisdom of the accessibility community.

Examples of accessibility best practices include:

- Providing descriptive link text rather than using generic phrases like "click here"
- Using proper heading structures to organize content hierarchically
- Ensuring form fields have visible labels and clear instructions
- Implementing skip navigation links to help keyboard users bypass repetitive content
- Providing visible focus indicators for interactive elements
- Using tables appropriately for tabular data rather than for layout purposes
- Avoiding content that flashes or blinks, which can trigger seizures

A high score in this metric indicates that a website has implemented many of these established best practices. This adoption demonstrates a commitment to accessibility beyond mere compliance with formal standards and suggests a more holistic approach to creating accessible user experiences.

By following accessibility best practices, websites can address a broader range of user needs and preferences, potentially improving usability for all users, not just those with disabilities. Many of these practices align with general principles of good web design, such as clarity, consistency, and user-centricity.

While not all best practices may be applicable to every website or situation, this metric provides valuable insights into the extent to which a website embraces accessibility as a fundamental aspect of its design and development process.
