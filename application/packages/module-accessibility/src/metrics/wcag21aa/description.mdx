## WCAG 2.1 Level AA

WCAG 2.1 Level AA extends the accessibility requirements of WCAG 2.1 Level A and adds more criteria to address additional barriers. This metric evaluates a website's compliance with both Level A and the intermediate Level AA criteria from the expanded guidelines, with significant additions for mobile accessibility, low vision, and cognitive impairments.

WCAG 2.1 Level AA incorporates all requirements from WCAG 2.0 Level AA while introducing several new success criteria. These additions reflect emerging accessibility needs related to modern web usage patterns and technologies.

Key additions in WCAG 2.1 Level AA include:

- Orientation: Ensuring content works in any screen orientation
- Identify Input Purpose: Making form fields' purpose programmatically determinable
- Reflow: Supporting content viewing without scrolling in two dimensions
- Non-Text Contrast: Providing sufficient contrast for important non-text elements
- Text Spacing: Allowing users to adjust text spacing without content loss
- Content on Hover or Focus: Making hover/focus content dismissible and persistent
- Status Messages: Ensuring status updates are announced to screen reader users

These criteria significantly benefit users with low vision, cognitive disabilities, and motor impairments, particularly those using mobile devices or assistive technologies. They reflect a more nuanced understanding of the barriers users face in modern web environments.

Level AA conformance is widely considered the target standard for accessibility compliance in many jurisdictions and organizations. The expanded WCAG 2.1 Level AA criteria offer a more comprehensive accessibility standard that addresses contemporary challenges.

A high score in this metric indicates that a website meets current industry expectations for accessibility and addresses barriers across a wide range of disabilities and technologies. It suggests a substantial commitment to digital inclusion that goes beyond basic compliance.

By meeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA criteria, websites provide improved accessibility for users with various disabilities, particularly those using mobile devices or with low vision, while maintaining compatibility with existing assistive technologies.
