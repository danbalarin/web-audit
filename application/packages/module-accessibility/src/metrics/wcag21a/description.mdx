## WCAG 2.1 Level A

WCAG 2.1 Level A builds upon the foundation of WCAG 2.0 Level A by adding new success criteria to address additional accessibility barriers. This metric evaluates a website's compliance with the minimum essential requirements of the expanded guidelines, with particular emphasis on mobile accessibility and cognitive disabilities.

WCAG 2.1 maintains all the Level A requirements from WCAG 2.0 while introducing new criteria to address gaps in the previous version. These additions reflect the evolution of web technologies and user needs, especially regarding mobile devices, touchscreens, and cognitive accessibility.

Key additions in WCAG 2.1 Level A include:

- Character Key Shortcuts: Ensuring keyboard shortcuts can be turned off or reconfigured
- Pointer Gestures: Making functionality operable through simple pointer gestures
- Pointer Cancellation: Allowing users to abort or undo pointer actions
- Label in Name: Making visible text labels match their accessible names
- Motion Actuation: Providing alternatives to motion-based interactions
- Content on Hover or Focus: Managing additional content that appears when hovering

These new criteria particularly benefit users with motor impairments, those using mobile devices, and individuals with cognitive disabilities. They address challenges that weren't as prevalent when WCAG 2.0 was released, such as the widespread use of touchscreen devices.

Compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level A indicates that a website meets the updated minimum accessibility requirements and addresses barriers across a wider range of devices and interaction methods. Organizations seeking to maintain current accessibility standards should consider WCAG 2.1 Level A as their new baseline.

A high score in this metric demonstrates that a website has incorporated more recent accessibility considerations while maintaining fundamental access for people with disabilities. It suggests an awareness of evolving accessibility needs beyond the original WCAG 2.0 requirements.

By meeting WCAG 2.1 Level A criteria, websites ensure basic accessibility across both traditional and more recent technologies, providing a more inclusive experience for all users.
