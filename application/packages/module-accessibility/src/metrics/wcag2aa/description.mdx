## WCAG 2.0 Level AA

WCAG 2.0 Level AA represents an intermediate level of accessibility conformance that builds upon the foundation of Level A requirements. This metric evaluates a website's compliance with both Level A and the additional Level AA criteria, offering a more comprehensive measure of accessibility.

Level AA criteria address significant barriers that could make web content difficult to use for many people with disabilities. While Level A focuses on the most basic access, Level AA aims to provide substantive support across a wider range of situations and technologies.

Key WCAG 2.0 Level AA requirements include:

- Providing captions for live audio content in synchronized media
- Ensuring sufficient color contrast between text and its background
- Enabling users to resize text without loss of content or functionality
- Using multiple ways to find content (search, site map, etc.)
- Using clear headings and labels to help users navigate
- Making the keyboard focus indicator visible
- Using consistent navigation and identification across pages
- Offering error suggestions and preventing critical errors
- Supporting assistive technologies with proper labeling and structures

Level AA conformance is widely considered the target standard for most websites and is frequently referenced in accessibility policies and legislation. Many government agencies and large organizations set Level AA as their required compliance level.

A high score in this metric indicates that a website is reasonably accessible to most users with disabilities across a variety of contexts. While not providing the highest level of support, Level AA conformance addresses major barriers faced by users with different types of disabilities.

By meeting WCAG 2.0 Level AA requirements, websites demonstrate a significant commitment to accessibility and provide a substantially improved experience for users of assistive technologies and those with various disabilities.
