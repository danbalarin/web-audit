## WCAG 2.0 Level A

WCAG 2.0 Level A represents the minimum level of accessibility conformance defined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. This metric evaluates a website's compliance with the most basic and essential accessibility requirements that must be satisfied to make web content accessible to people with disabilities.

Level A criteria address fundamental accessibility barriers that would completely prevent certain users from accessing content. These requirements form the baseline for accessibility and focus on ensuring that basic functionality is available to all users regardless of their abilities or the assistive technologies they use.

Key WCAG 2.0 Level A requirements include:

- Providing text alternatives for non-text content like images
- Creating content that can be presented in different ways without losing information
- Making all functionality available from a keyboard
- Giving users enough time to read and use content
- Not designing content in ways known to cause seizures
- Providing ways to help users navigate and find content
- Making text content readable and understandable
- Making web pages operate in predictable ways
- Helping users avoid and correct mistakes

Compliance with WCAG 2.0 Level A is often considered the first step in making websites accessible and may be legally required in some jurisdictions. Many organizations and governments use these criteria as the minimum standard for accessibility.

A high score in this metric indicates that a website has addressed the most critical accessibility barriers and has taken significant steps toward basic accessibility compliance. However, it's important to note that Level A conformance alone may not make content fully accessible to all users with disabilities.

By meeting WCAG 2.0 Level A requirements, websites ensure that people with disabilities can at least access the basic content and functionality, even if they may encounter some difficulties or require more effort compared to users without disabilities.
