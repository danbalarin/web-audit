## Cross Origin Resource Sharing

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by browsers that controls how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources from another domain. This metric evaluates whether a website properly configures CORS headers to maintain security while enabling necessary cross-origin functionality.

CORS extends the same-origin policy, which is a fundamental security concept that restricts how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin. Without CORS, browsers prohibit web applications from making cross-origin requests, which can prevent many legitimate interactions between services.

The CORS mechanism works through a set of HTTP headers that define which origins are permitted to access resources:

- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Specifies which origins can access the resource
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Indicates the allowed HTTP methods
- Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Lists the headers that can be used in the request
- Access-Control-Max-Age: Defines how long the preflight response can be cached
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: Indicates whether the request can include credentials

When properly configured, CORS allows websites to:
- Securely access APIs and services hosted on different domains
- Share resources across subdomains or partner services
- Enable third-party integrations while maintaining security boundaries
- Support modern web architecture patterns like microservices

However, overly permissive CORS configurations (such as using wildcard "*" origins) can create security vulnerabilities by allowing unauthorized domains to access sensitive data or functionality. Conversely, overly restrictive CORS settings can prevent legitimate functionality from working properly.

A positive score in this metric indicates that the website implements CORS policies that balance security with necessary functionality. This demonstrates awareness of cross-origin security considerations and proper implementation of access controls.

By correctly configuring CORS, websites can maintain strong security boundaries while enabling the integrations and resource sharing needed for modern web applications to function effectively.
