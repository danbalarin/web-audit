# Security

Web security encompasses the protective measures and protocols implemented to safeguard websites, web applications, and web services against various cyber threats and vulnerabilities. This category evaluates a website's security posture by examining several critical security controls, headers, and configurations.

The security metrics in this module focus on important aspects of web security including transport layer protection, defense against common web attacks, secure cookie handling, and detection of vulnerable dependencies. Each metric represents a specific security control or practice that contributes to overall website security.

These metrics help identify potential security weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers to compromise a website's confidentiality, integrity, or availability. By addressing these security issues, website owners can reduce their vulnerability to common attack vectors such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), clickjacking, data breaches, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Security is not just about protecting the website itselfâ€”it's also about protecting users' data and privacy. Many of these security controls directly impact how well a website protects sensitive user information from unauthorized access or exploitation. This is particularly important for websites that handle personal information, authentication credentials, or financial data.

It's worth noting that these automated tests can identify many security configuration issues, but comprehensive security requires ongoing attention to multiple layers of protection, including server security, application security, and regular updates to address new vulnerabilities. These metrics serve as indicators of security practices rather than a complete security assessment.

By monitoring and improving these security metrics, website owners can enhance their defensive posture against common web threats and demonstrate a commitment to protecting both their assets and their users' data in an increasingly complex threat landscape.
