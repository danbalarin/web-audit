## SSL Certificate

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates are digital documents that authenticate a website's identity and enable encrypted connections. This metric evaluates the presence, validity, and security characteristics of a website's SSL/TLS certificate.

SSL/TLS certificates serve two primary purposes: they verify that a website is owned by a legitimate entity, and they establish an encrypted connection to protect data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server. This encryption is crucial for protecting sensitive information such as login credentials, personal details, and payment information.

Key aspects evaluated in this metric include:
- Certificate validity: Whether the certificate is active and not expired
- Certificate authenticity: Whether it's issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
- Domain match: Whether the certificate correctly matches the website's domain
- Security level: The strength of the encryption and hash algorithms used
- Certificate chain: The proper configuration of intermediate certificates
- Key length: Whether key sizes meet current security standards
- Vulnerability to known issues: Protection against threats like Heartbleed or POODLE

The importance of proper SSL/TLS implementation extends beyond basic security. Search engines now favor HTTPS websites in their rankings, browsers display security warnings for sites without valid certificates, and users increasingly expect the security assurance of the padlock icon in their address bar.

A positive result in this metric indicates that a website has implemented proper encryption for data in transit, helping to protect users from various attacks including eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data tampering. A negative result suggests potential security vulnerabilities that could compromise user data.

By maintaining a valid, properly configured SSL/TLS certificate, websites demonstrate a commitment to security fundamentals and help establish trust with their users. This protective measure is now considered a baseline requirement for any professional website, especially those handling sensitive information.
