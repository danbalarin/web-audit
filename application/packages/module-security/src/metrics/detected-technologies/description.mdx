## Detected Technologies

Detected Technologies is a security metric that identifies and analyzes the various software frameworks, libraries, content management systems, server technologies, and third-party services used by a website. This metric helps evaluate potential security implications based on the technology stack in use.

Website technology detection works by examining various indicators including HTTP headers, HTML markup patterns, JavaScript libraries, CSS signatures, and other distinctive elements that reveal which technologies are being used. This process creates a comprehensive inventory of the site's technical components, providing valuable context for security assessments.

The data collected includes information about:
- Content Management Systems (WordPress, Drupal, etc.)
- JavaScript frameworks and libraries (React, Angular, jQuery, etc.)
- E-commerce platforms (Shopify, Magento, etc.)
- Web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS, etc.)
- Programming languages (PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.)
- Analytics services (Google Analytics, Matomo, etc.)
- Marketing tools and advertising platforms
- Content delivery networks (CDNs)
- Security tools and services

This information is valuable for several security-related reasons:
- Identifying outdated or vulnerable components that might need updating
- Understanding the attack surface based on known vulnerabilities in specific technologies
- Recognizing security implications of certain technology combinations
- Assessing potential compliance issues related to third-party services
- Planning security testing strategies based on the technology stack

Unlike other security metrics that directly measure pass/fail conditions, this metric primarily provides informational context. The security implications depend on factors such as the specific versions in use, patch levels, configuration details, and how different technologies interact.

By understanding a website's technology stack, security professionals can make more informed decisions about potential vulnerabilities, recommend appropriate security measures, and develop targeted testing strategies that address the specific risks associated with the detected technologies.
