## Time to First Byte (TTFB)

Time to First Byte (TTFB) is a crucial performance metric that measures the duration between a user's request for a web page and the moment the first byte of data is received by the browser.
This metric encompasses several stages of the initial connection process, including the DNS lookup, the TCP connection, the TLS/SSL negotiation, and the server's processing time to build and send the response.
Essentially, TTFB reflects how quickly a server responds to a request, providing insight into the efficiency of both the network and the server's backend processing.

A good TTFB value is typically under 200 milliseconds.
Values between 200 and 600 milliseconds are considered acceptable, while TTFB exceeding 600 milliseconds is generally seen as poor.
High TTFB values can indicate issues in the initial connection stages, such as slow server processing, inefficient backend code, or network latency.
These delays can negatively impact the overall user experience, as they may cause noticeable lags before any content begins to load in the browser.

Optimizing TTFB often involves addressing factors that contribute to delays in the initial connection process.
This can include optimizing server-side code to reduce processing time, implementing effective caching strategies for dynamic content, and choosing a faster hosting provider or utilizing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to reduce latency.
Additionally, minimizing redirects and optimizing database queries can significantly improve TTFB by reducing the time the server takes to prepare the response.
