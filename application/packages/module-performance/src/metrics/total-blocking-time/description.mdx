## Total Blocking Time (TBT)

Total Blocking Time (TBT) is a crucial web performance metric that measures the total amount of time during which the main thread of the browser is blocked and unable to respond to user interactions.
Specifically, TBT quantifies the sum of all time periods between the [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](category:performance,metric:first-contentful-paint) and the [Time to Interactive (TTI)](category:performance,metric:time-to-interactive) where tasks exceed 50 milliseconds in duration.
These tasks are known as "long tasks," and their blocking time is calculated as any time beyond the initial 50 milliseconds of each task.

The main thread in a browser is responsible for executing scripts, rendering layouts, and handling user interactions.
Since it operates on a single thread, it can only process one task at a time.
When the main thread is occupied with long tasks, it cannot promptly respond to user inputs like clicks, taps, or scrolls.
This leads to a sluggish user experience, where the website feels unresponsive or laggy.

To calculate TBT, each long task's blocking time is identified and then summed up.
For example, if there are two long tasks—one with a total duration of 200 milliseconds (150 milliseconds of blocking time) and another with 250 milliseconds (200 milliseconds of blocking time)—the TBT would be the sum of the blocking times: 150 ms + 200 ms = 350 ms.

A lower TBT indicates that the main thread is not heavily blocked and can quickly respond to user interactions. 
Generally, a TBT of less than 200 milliseconds is considered good. 
Websites achieving this benchmark are likely to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.
TBT values exceeding 600 milliseconds are considered poor and can lead to noticeable delays and frustration for users interacting with the website.
