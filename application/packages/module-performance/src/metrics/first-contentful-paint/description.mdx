## First Contentful Paint (FCP)

First Contentful Paint (FCP) is a critical metric in web performance that measures the time from when a user navigates to a page until the browser renders the first piece of content from the Document Object Model (DOM).
This content could be text, images, SVGs, or non-white `<canvas>` elements.
FCP is significant because it represents the point at which users first perceive that the page is loading, moving them away from a blank screen and providing initial feedback that their request is being processed.

FCP is considered an important milestone in the loading process because it directly impacts user experience.
Before FCP occurs, users may feel that the site is unresponsive or slow, which can lead to frustration or abandonment.
By optimizing for a quicker FCP, websites can enhance user engagement, reduce bounce rates, and potentially increase conversions.
This makes FCP a valuable Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for businesses aiming to improve site performance and user satisfaction.

In terms of benchmarks, Google Developer guidelines suggest that an FCP under 1.8 seconds is considered fast, while an FCP over 3 seconds is deemed slow.
According to the HTTP Archive, the median FCP for mobile websites is approximately 3.8 seconds, and for desktop websites, it's around 2.3 seconds.
Therefore, aiming for an FCP below 1.8 seconds can place a website among the faster-loading sites and contribute to a better user experience.

Improving FCP involves optimizing the critical rendering path, which is the sequence of steps the browser takes to convert HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen.
Developers and designers can enhance FCP by carefully managing how files are loaded.
This might include reducing render-blocking resources, optimizing CSS code, deferring non-critical JavaScript, and prioritizing the loading of visible content.
Monitoring FCP alongside other metrics like [Time to First Byte (TTFB)](performance:time-to-first-byte) can help identify whether delays are due to server response times or rendering issues on the client side.

FCP is closely related to other metrics such as First Paint and Start Render.
While First Paint measures the time when the browser first renders anything that isn't white space (which could be a background color change), FCP specifically measures when the first piece of content is painted.
Start Render is similar but can only be measured in synthetic testing environments and detects when any visible element appears on the page.
FCP, on the other hand, can be measured for real-world users, providing valuable insights into the actual user experience.
