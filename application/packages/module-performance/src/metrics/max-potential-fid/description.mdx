## Max Potential First Input Delay (Max Potential FID)

Max Potential First Input Delay (Max Potential FID) is a performance metric that measures the longest task in a webpage's load process that could delay user interaction.
It represents the maximum amount of time a user might have to wait for the browser to respond to their first interaction, such as clicking a button or tapping a link.
By identifying the longest period during which the main thread is busy and cannot respond to user inputs, Max Potential FID provides insight into the worst-case responsiveness scenario for a page.

A low Max Potential FID value indicates that the page is likely to respond quickly to user interactions, as there are no long tasks blocking the main thread.
This leads to a smoother and more responsive user experience.
Generally, a Max Potential FID of less than 100 milliseconds is considered good and suggests that users will perceive the page as responsive.
Values between 100 and 300 milliseconds are acceptable but may indicate some room for improvement.
A value exceeding 300 milliseconds is considered poor, suggesting that users may experience noticeable delays when trying to interact with the page.

High Max Potential FID values typically result from long-running JavaScript tasks or heavy computational work on the main thread during the page load.
To improve this metric, developers can focus on optimizing and deferring non-critical JavaScript, breaking up long tasks into smaller, asynchronous chunks, and minimizing render-blocking resources.
By reducing the length of tasks that monopolize the main thread, the page becomes more responsive, enhancing the overall user experience.
